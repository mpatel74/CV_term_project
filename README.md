# CV_term_project

source file contains three face detection codes.
1.Face_detection_Haar_C.py
2.Face_detection_LBP.py
3.Face_detection_MTCNN.py

One combined approach of face detection is implemented in following file.
4. Face_detection_realtime_Haar_LBP.py

First three python files uses images from "Dataset" directory as input images.
Outputs are stored in the output directory.
Face_detection_Haar_C.py and Face_detection_LBP.py uses pretrained models, so their xml files are also included in the source file. 

Face_detection_realtime_Haar_LBP.py needs to access the device camera. Please grant the permission for it when asked.
